# rock-paper-scissors
ðŸ¤– A simple machine learning to classification an image into three category rock, paper, or scissors.

## Built With

* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) - Colab notebooks allow you to combine executable code and rich text in a single document, along with images, HTML, LaTeX and more.
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - The core open source library to help you develop and train ML models. Get started quickly by running Colab notebooks directly in your browser.
* [Keras](https://keras.io/) - is an API designed for human beings, not machines. Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load: it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear & actionable error messages. It also has extensive documentation and developer guides.

## Getting Started

To run this project you need a google colab to run python jupiter notebooks, you can follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Register google collab using your google account

* Google Collabs 
```sh
https://colab.research.google.com/
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rasatmaja/rock-paper-scissors.git
```
2. Upload Jupiter notebook into google collabs
```sh
File > Upload Notebook
```
3. Run the notebook by click run for every code cell
4. Play with it ðŸ¤“
